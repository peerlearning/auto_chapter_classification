# List of terms to exclude

Some LaTeX terms can be excluded from this list:

1. "text". This is indicative of the LaTeX \text{ } stuff.
2. "left"
3. "right". Left and right are mostly for parantheses.
4. "frac"
5. "rightarrow": The implies sign in Maths. Very common here!
6. "therefore": A stop word in Maths, eh?
